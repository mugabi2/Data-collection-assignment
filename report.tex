\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}
To find out  the distribution of students of different coarses around campus hostels.

\subsection{SCOPE}
In this research, hostels and homes around campus and halls in campus are covered. 

\section{METHODS USED TO COLLECT DATA}
\textbf{Interviews;}
I interviewed different students asking them the courses they take and where they stay.
\textbf{ODK collect}
ODK collect was used to record information from the interviews, take a snap of the student, take the GPS coordinates and record date and time of collection of the data. 

\section{MATERIALS USED}
\textbf{A personal computer}
This was used to access the internet for software and uploading work to github
\textbf{An smart phone}
ODK collect was installed on my android device for collecting data
\textbf{Open Data Kit}
A form designed using ODK build, through ODK collect, was used to record information from the interviews, take a snap of the student, take the GPS coordinates and record date and time of collection of the data. Data collected was later sent to an aggregate server at http://trialprojected.appspot.com
\textbf{Google AppEngine platform}
This was used to build the aggregate server

\section{ANALYSIS OF DATA}
